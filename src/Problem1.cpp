/*
Given a Binary Tree of N Nodes, which have unique values in the range of 
[0,N](Inclusive)  with one value(Node) missing in that sequence.
Return that missing value .

Example 1 : N=5 
   3
  / \
 4   1
    / \
   5   0
Missing Value is 2 ,Sequence is [0,1,2,3,4,5]

Example 2 : N=8
      2
     / \
    4   5
   / \ / \
  3  1 6  8
 /
0
Missing Value is 7 ,Sequence is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

Constaints : 
-10000<=N<=10000 [N will not be equal to 0]



Input :
Struct node Root Address
Output :
Return Missing Value .
Return -1 for NULL Inputs 

Note:
Dont Create an Extra Array/String ,or else your solution would receive 30% Cut in the Marks you got for this
question .
